            <h2>Vagabond</h2>
            <p>Written and illustrated by the amazingly talanted <strong>Takehiko Inoue</strong> - Sensei.</p>
            <h3>Sypnosis</h3>
            <p>In 16th century Japan, <strong>Shinmen Takezou</strong> is a wild, rough young man, in both his appearance and his actions.<br> 
               His aggressive nature has won him the collective reproach and fear of his village, leading him and his best friend,<br> 
               Matahachi Honiden, to run away in search of something grander than provincial life.<br> 
               The pair enlist in the Toyotomi army, yearning for glory—but when the Toyotomi suffer a crushing defeat<br> 
               at the hands of the Tokugawa Clan at the Battle of Sekigahara, the friends barely make it out alive.<br><br>
               After the two are separated, Shinmen returns home on a self-appointed mission to notify the Hon'iden family of Matahachi's survival.<br>
               He instead finds himself a wanted criminal, framed for his friend's supposed murder based on his history of violence.<br> 
               Upon being captured, he is strung up on a tree and left to die.<br>
               An itinerant monk, the distinguished Takuan Soho, takes pity on the "devil child,"<br>
               secretly freeing Shinmen and christening him with a new name to avoid pursuit by the authorities: <strong>Musashi Miyamoto</strong>.<br><br>
               <em>Vagabond</em> is the fictitious retelling of the life of one of Japan's most renowned swordsmen,<br> 
               the "Sword Saint" Musashi Miyamoto—his rise from a swordsman with no desire other than to become <em>"Invincible Under the Heavens"</em><br>
               to an enlightened warrior who slowly learns of the importance of close friends, self-reflection, and life itself.</p>
